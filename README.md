# Shaky Roads

So, you know how some roads are really bumpy and bad?
 
Well, this app measures *how* bad the roads you drive on are.

I am making this app because:

* Im doing a datascience course and thought this would be cool data to analyze and make pretty graphs of.
* Im bored.
* Maybe it could be useful in traffic monitoring and predictions?
