# Shaky Roads [WIP]

This code uses your phones accelerometer and GPS to measure movement and your location
and dumps those readings to a csv file, then using that data you can make a map of road quality.

I am making this app because:

* Im doing a datascience course and thought this would be cool data to analyze and make pretty graphs of.
* Im bored.
* Maybe it could be useful in traffic predictions?

### TODO

- [ ] get gps working
- [ ] dump readings to a csv file
- [ ] plot acceleration readings onto a map
