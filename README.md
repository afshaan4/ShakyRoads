# Shaky Roads [WIP]

An app to record road quality, so here's the idea: read the accelerometer and GPS then save them to
a csv so you can plot the acceleration readings to a map or make pretty graphs and all that.

Uses androids [linear accelerometer](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_motion#sensors-motion-linear)
 to filter out acceleration from gravity

**Note:** It takes a while after you turn on your phones GPS till it gets your location
