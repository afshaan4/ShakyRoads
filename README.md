# Shaky Roads [WIP]

This code uses your phones accelerometer and GPS to measure movement and your location
and dumps those readings to a csv file, then using that data you can make a map of road quality.

**Note:** It takes a while after you turn on your phones GPS till it displays your latitude and longitude.

### TODO

- [ ] get it to open setting and ask user to enable the gps
- [ ] dump readings to a csv file
- [ ] plot acceleration readings onto a map
